        "The results table and performance plot summarizes the performance of all models using the same evaluation protocol. The baseline (random stratified) provides a lower bound, showing the accuracy we would expect without any real learning. Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression outperform this baseline by a large margin, indicating that TF-IDF features capture strong predictive signals in the review text. Our final LinearSVC model achieves the highest accuracy and F1 score, demonstrating that combining richer TF-IDF features with a stronger linear classifier provides the most effective solution for this task."
