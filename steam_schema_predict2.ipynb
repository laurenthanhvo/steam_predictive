        "Linear SVC achieves the highest F1 score but has the lowest accuracy, suggesting it is better at identifying minority classes but struggles with the distribution of the most common labels. Because Linear SVC does not output class probabilities, a Top-5 score cannot be computed, which is why it shows NaN in the results table.\n",

        "\n",
        "Overall, the models show that TF-IDF review text does contain predictive information, even though the task is challenging and heavily imbalanced. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression provide modest gains over the baseline, while Linear SVC excels in F1 performance by capturing more detailed distinctions between classes. Although no single model is universally superior across all metrics, the results demonstrate that different algorithms capture different aspects of the review data, and that even simple text-based features can meaningfully contribute to next-game prediction."

        "##Limitations and Areas for Improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite using review text and playtime information, the overall accuracy across all models remains low. This reflects the fundamental difficulty of predicting a user’s next game—players often jump across genres, try new releases, or play games based on social influence or sales, all of which introduce randomness that the model cannot observe.\n",
        "\n",
        "While playtime is included in the dataset, in this setup it is not directly integrated into the predictive features, so the models cannot actually learn from it. Even if it were added, raw playtime alone does not fully capture user preference—some players try games briefly, leave early reviews, or accumulate hours over years, making playtime noisy and inconsistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another major limitation is the extreme class imbalance. A few games appear very frequently, while most titles appear only a handful of times. This causes the baseline predictor to look deceptively strong and makes it difficult for models to learn meaningful patterns for less common games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text-based TF-IDF features also limit the understanding of game similarity. The models treat each review independently and cannot detect deeper patterns in genre, mechanics, or themes. Linear SVC, while strong, cannot output probabilities, which is why its Top-5 score is missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Ways to Improve Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "To meaningfully boost accuracy, the model would benefit from richer, more structured information, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using playtime more effectively\n",
        "Incorporate it as a feature or engineer signals like “long-term engagement,” “short trial,” or “review-to-playtime ratio.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding game metadata\n",
        "Genre, tags, popularity, release year, ESRB rating, or platform would help the model recognize similarity between games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using user history\n",
        "Instead of only one review → next game, use sequences (RNN/Transformer-based recommenders like SASRec or GRU4Rec).\n",
        "\n",
        "Better text representations\n",
        "Replace TF-IDF with BERT/SentenceTransformer embeddings trained on gaming content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handling imbalance\n",
        "Class weighting, oversampling, or grouping games into categories to stabilize predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we have playtime data, the current modeling setup does not fully utilize it—and even when included, predicting the next game remains a challenging, high-variance task. Improving performance will require richer user features, game-level metadata, and models tailored for sequence prediction. These changes would allow the system to capture deeper patterns in user behavior and game similarity, ultimately making next-game predictions far more reliable."
